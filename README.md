*Contreebutors* is a small library that makes it easy to keep a list of all people that contributed to a project (most often an open-source project). It's really easy to use - just run the `contreebutors add --username {GITHUB_USERNAME}` command and the tool will add the given contributor to the `contreebutors.json` file, and more importantly, update the list of all contributors at the end of your project's README.md file.

## Install
```
npm install contreebutors --save-dev
```

Or if you prefer yarn: 
```
yarn add contreebutors --dev
```

## CLI

The following will create a `contreebutors.json` file in the current working directory, and render the list of contributors at the end of your `README.md` file:

```
contreebutors add --username doitadrian
```

Note that the command doesn't perform any Git commits.

## Code

You can also use the `Contreebutors` class and execute commands via code. This might be useful if you're trying to include the library in your CI/CD pipeline.

```ts
import { Contreebutors } from "contreebutors";

(...)

const contreebutors = new Contreebutors();
await contreebutors.add({ username: "doitadrian"});
```

Again, this will only make the changes to the files. No Git commits will be performed.

## GitHub Action
