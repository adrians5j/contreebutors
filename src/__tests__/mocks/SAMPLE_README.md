# Welcome!

This is a sample README file that contains some text and will be used for testing the ConðŸŒ³butors library.

Let's give it a try!

# Another section

This could be another section, but let's leave it blank. We only want to test the library.

## Install
```
npm install --save contreebutors
```

Or if you prefer yarn: 
```
yarn add contreebutors
```

## Basic usage
`yarn contreebutors`
